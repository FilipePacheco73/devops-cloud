Summary
Welcome to the DevOps-Cloud repository! This repository showcases my journey and experiments as I upskill to become a MultiCloud Practitioner. I am also implementing DevOps best practices to deploy various projects in a Cloud environment.

Requirements
Each project and experiment in this repository is organized into separate folders, each with its own specific requirements and files needed to reproduce the application.

Projects
Hello-World-Web-Page: This project contains an HTML file that displays a simple "Hello World" message.

Calculator-Web-Page: This project features a web page developed using the Python Flask framework. It simulates a calculator that saves calculations in a CSV file, serving as an emulation of a database. The historical calculations can be viewed on a dedicated page.
